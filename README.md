Hey VR!
===========

This is a pool of examples of Virtual Reality on the Web using existing Frameworks. At the moment the only Framework used is [A-FRAME](https://aframe.io).

### [A-FRAME](https://aframe.io)
* A web framework for building virtual reality experiences.
* With HTML and Entity-Component ecosystem.
* Works on:
  * HTC Vive
  * Rift
  * Desktop (Browsers, mainly Firefox and Chrome)
  * Mobile Platforms

I'm writing an introduction post that will be available very soon. Until there, you can visit the [A-frame](https://aframe.io) website and check out the demos there. You can also check my own demonstrations, after all, this is all this repository is about.
